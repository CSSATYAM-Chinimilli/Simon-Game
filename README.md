# Simon-Game

Description
This project is a digital implementation of the classic Simon game. Simon is a memory game where players need to repeat a sequence of lights and sounds generated by the game. The sequences become progressively longer and more complex as the game progresses. The goal is to see how long the player can keep up with the increasingly difficult sequences.

Features
Interactive gameplay: Players can click or tap on buttons to repeat the sequence.
Sound effects: Each button press and sequence playback is accompanied by audio cues.
Progressive difficulty: The game becomes more challenging as the player successfully completes each sequence.
Score tracking: Players can track their high scores to compete against themselves or others.

Technologies Used
HTML: For the structure of the game interface.
CSS: For styling the game interface and adding animations.
JavaScript: For implementing the game logic, generating sequences, handling user input, and managing game state.
Audio files: To add sound effects to the game.

How to Play
Open the game in a web browser.
Press ANY button on the keyboardto begin the game.
Pay attention to the sequence of buttons that light up and the accompanying sounds.
Repeat the sequence by clicking or tapping on the corresponding buttons.
If you correctly repeat the sequence, the game will add another step to the sequence and play it back to you.
Continue playing until you make a mistake or choose to stop the game.
